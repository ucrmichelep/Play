I wonder if this will work in OSF

It did, but had a generic commit message

So it might be better to make the change in Git.  On the from page of the OSF there is a View/Edit in Git option. 

So I tried that and it seems that the GitHub itself has a generic message "Updated $.$"
It had a submessage that I thought was the commit message.  The Was the extended commit message.

Another useful thing to know is that if you click on the view in github button, it does not open a new tab.  One has to hit 
the back button to get back to ones OSF project.

It also does not seem possible to create a new file in GitHub from OSF
